            ANCYPF is set up by a group of people driven by a common interest
            which is to improve the lives of Christian Youths in Nigeria and in
            all Nations arround the World by providing the needed services free
            of charge. We are living in a country where many youths are subject
            to untold hardship, Emotional trauma,poverty ,unemployment ,sin etc.
            Our emergence and presence is to proffer solutions to these
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many youths out there who are seeking for help and
            assistance, calling on the government of the day to come to their
            rescue but their voices are not heard. The Nigerian government has
            failed at this therefore , this NGO is established to not only help
            and attend to these areas by equiping Nigerian christian Youths but
            also to raise rugged youths that are burning for christ with a view
            to generating work force for end time revival
